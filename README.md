# ecommerce-site-backend
This project is a construction of a functioning back end for an e-commerce website, using Express, mySQL, Insomnia, and Sequelize.
The user needs to provide their credentials in the .env file, and use mySQL to enter the schema.ql and create a database, then run node seeds to seed data to work with in the database. Users can use the appropriate routes to view all categories, products, and tags, along with the associated models. Users can also use POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia to add, update, or delete the respective category, product, or tag.
